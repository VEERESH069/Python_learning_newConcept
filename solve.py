# Below is the python code with solution
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
# Explanation: 
# nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
# nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
# nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
# The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
# Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.

# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000
# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

# Input: s = "III"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: III = 3.
